# Yo, I’m @TheAndileLanga
## About Me 
Hi, I am *The Andile Langa*, but you can call me Andile. I'm a graphic designer, digital artist/illustrator and animator. 
Most days you can find me at `LGA Media designing websites and helping my clients with all their online presence needs, of course when I'm not doing that 
I'm drawing, writing and making pictures move. 

## My interests 
Illustration and art are major interests of mine. I love all sorts of creative expressions from traditional works made with graphite, ink and paint to 
digital art that encompasses graphic design, animation and even generative AI art. Of course, I like a lot of other things including: 
- 🏀 basketball, because like who doesn't? 
- 🏎️ Fast cars... and on that note Tracy Chapman.
- 🎮 video games
- 📸 photography and 📹 videography... and honestly anything to do with visuals creating them, curating them and appreciating them. 
--------
- 📖 I'm currently learning more about game design and development. 
- 👀 Right now I'm working on a little project called the 2BS Arcade.
